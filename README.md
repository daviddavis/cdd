CDD (Coffee-Driven Development)

*What is Coffee-Driven Development (CDD)?*

CDD is the idea that the development of software can be driven by caffeine.

*Why not use Caffeine-Driven Development instead of Coffee-Driven Development?*

I don't know. Do I look like I have all the answers?!

*How do you estimate work?*

In cups of coffee. Duh.
