CDD (Coffee-Driven Development)
===============================

**What is this repository for?**

This repo is meant to be the temporary home for a new style of development,
Coffee-Driven Development (CDD). Eventually we hope to post more information
about CDD. However, in the mean time, we're brewing a few pots and we encourage
you do the same.

**What is Coffee-Driven Development (CDD)?**

CDD is the idea that the development of software can be driven by caffeine.

**Why not use Caffeine-Driven Development instead of Coffee-Driven Development?**

I don't know. Do I look like I have all the answers?!

**How do you estimate work?**

In cups of coffee. Duh.
